ISSUE
	when a client starts a game then disconnect, game should be deleted if no player left
	client list handled in Client is not updated when a new client connects (in fact OnClientGameJoined is received before client list has been updated -> client is not found locally -> id is null)

TYPO
	jointed instead joined in log/console

admin
	get one client/admin/room full information
client
	generic Client
	WPF Client

uniformize game/room wording
